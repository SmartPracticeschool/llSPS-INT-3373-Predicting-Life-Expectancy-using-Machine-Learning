#SPS_PRO_215-Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning - SB43733

#Project description

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.


According to the required skill set and the assumptions for designing a project, it is designed according to the need of the required output.

Project development environment is very important for successfully execution of the project. Thats why, will create this using IBM resources.

This prediction problem was divided into two categories:-

Existing system:- whole concept of life expectancy depends on the interpretation given to “full health”,occupational or social class, area level deprivation, geographical area of residence (urban and rural), housing tenure.

Proposed solution:- Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria are also considered,The project uses immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors to predict life expectancy of a country for a given year using a machine learning model.

=> For these tasks, we required data sets for analysis of data on above mentioned basis. The Dataset file is actually taken from Kaggle.
